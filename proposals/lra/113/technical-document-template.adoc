== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Backwards Compatibility

* Having a new client might affect application using the internal NarayanaLRAClient, tough the actual client is internal so just announcing the changes and releasing it as a minor should be enough. 

== Security Considerations

- Unit tests and Integration tests are required to check the new client API is safe. Consider users and microservices can use the new API.

== Test Plan
- Add unit test and integration tests (with the use of the Coordinator). 
- Integration tests might be implemented with failsafe plugin and included under lra-test module. The WildFly Coordinator can be used for this purpose.

== Community Documentation

- Integrate implementation details here:  https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/blob/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/project/lra/jaxrs.adoc
- Consider the lra documentation will soon be part of the lra project.

== Release Note Content
- Removal of internal NarayanaLRAClient. Please use the new Microprofile REST Client instead.
