== Requirements

////
The author is required to provide a comprehensive plan outlining their intended strategy for
the implementation of each explicitly stated requirement as reported in the technical document.
This plan must maintain a level of specificity adequate to clarify the author's design rationales
for each requirement. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the plan should serve as
a high-level design overview, providing valuable insights into the author's conceptual choices
for satisfying each requirement, rather than overly detailed step-by-step instructions.
Once the pull request to fulfil the Request for Enhancement (RFE) is raised, a code review will
be conducted to address the technical details of the developed solution.
